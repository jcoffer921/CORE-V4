# CORE: Your C++ Virtual Assistant

**CORE** is a multifunctional, terminal-based virtual assistant built in C++. It is designed to support users through educational tools, interactive programs, wellness checks, and practical utilities. This project serves both as a robust application and a hands-on learning environment for C++ developers.

## Features

- **Mathematics Toolkit**: Perform basic arithmetic, solve quadratic equations, check parity and positivity, convert currencies, calculate perimeter and area, and more.
- **Flashcard Study App**: Create, shuffle, delete, and review flashcards stored using file I/O.
- **Virtual Shopping Cart**: Simulate adding items, calculating totals, and applying discounts to mimic a real-world checkout experience.
- **Games**: Includes Tic-Tac-Toe (with play again feature), NBA trivia quizzes, and a fashion personalization game.
- **Object-Oriented Demos**: Hands-on exploration of C++ OOP concepts through classes like Dog, Superhero, Taco, Rectangle, FastFood, and more.
- **VELMA** (Virtual Emotional & Lifestyle Medical Assistant): Provides a ten-question stress self-assessment and delivers personalized wellness recommendations based on the user's score.
